# Urban Walkability Project
- [Noise Diagonotor for New York City](http://uwalk.elasticbeanstalk.com/noise)

This repo stores the web system of the urban walkability project, initiated by Dr. Cheng-Te Li in Academia Sinica, Taiwan, and currently maintained by Mr. Tzu-Chi Yen. The project aims to collect urban multi-modal data and suggest open algorithmic models to offer insights for social good. Its first deployment was on urban noise, in which the noise composition of any place in a city can be inferred from multimodal multimedia.
