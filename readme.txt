DESCRIPTION

This repo stores the web system of the urban walkability project, initiated
by Dr. Cheng-Te Li in Academia Sinica, Taiwan, and currently maintained by 
Mr. Tzu-Chi Yen. The project aims to collect urban multi-modal data and 
suggest open algorithmic models to offer insights for social good. 

Its first deployment was on urban noise, in which the noise composition of 
any place in a city can be inferred from multimodal multimedia.
