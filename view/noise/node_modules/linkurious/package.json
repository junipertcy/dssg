Graphs are a powerful way to represent any relationships in data like social networks (i.e. who likes who), infrastructure (i.e. how devices are connected), flows (i.e. where does the money go), and much more.\r\n\r\nLinkurious.js provides a collection of **HTML5** features based on [Sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org/), the fastest open source Javascript graph drawing engine on the market. Linkurious.js is published in dual licenses, **available under both commercial and GNU GPLv3 licenses** (see below).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[\r\n![glyphs-icons](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/glyphs-icons-230.gif)\r\n![edge-shapes](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/edge-shapes-230.gif)\r\n![filters](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/filters-230.gif)\r\n![forceatlas](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/forceatlas-230.gif)\r\n![glyphs](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/glyphs-230.gif)\r\n![halo](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/halo-230.gif)\r\n![hover-edge](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/hover-edge-230.gif)\r\n![designer](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/designer-230.gif)\r\n![drag](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/drag-multiple-nodes-230.gif)\r\n![layout-arctic](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/layout-arctic-230.gif)\r\n![level-of-details-edges-labels](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/level-of-details-edges-labels-230.gif)\r\n![node-icons](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/node-icons-230.gif)\r\n![pie-charts](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/pie-charts-230.gif)\r\n![self-loop](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/self-loop-230.gif)\r\n![tooltips](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/media/tooltips-230.gif)\r\n](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nLinkurious.js is developed in pure Javascript. It uses Sigma.js for its graph data structure and visualization engine, which provides both **Canvas**, **WebGL** and **SVG** renderers for nodes and edges. Sigma.js is highly flexible thanks to its modular architecture, and is extensible by plugins. The linkurious.js toolkit is made of **more than 30 Sigma.js plugins**, combined to work together and tested for integration into modern Web applications.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\nThe [wiki](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki) provides documentation on APIs, and you can start learning how to code with Linkurious.js with the `examples` and `test` directories.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\n\r\nTo use it, clone the repository:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:Linkurious/linkurious.js.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can try the examples in the `examples/` directory to see how to use sigma.\r\n\r\nTo build the code:\r\n\r\n - Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).\r\n - Install [gjslint](https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/docs/linter_howto?hl=en).\r\n - Use `npm install` to install sigma development dependencies.\r\n - Use `npm run build` to minify the code with [Uglify](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS). The minified files `sigma.min.js` and sigma plugins will then be accessible in the `build/` folder.\r\n\r\nYou can also customize the build by adding or removing files from the `coreJsFiles` array in `Gruntfile.js` before applying the grunt task.\r\n\r\nYou can also get the code directly from the `dist/` without having to build it yourself.\r\n\r\nYou can also use `rawgit` for testing:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"https://rawgit.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/develop/dist/sigma.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why linkurious.js?\r\n\r\nAt [Linkurious SAS](http://linkurio.us) we are big fans of Sigma.js. We use it extensively in our applications because it is an efficient graph *viewer*, but application developers like us need more high level and integration-ready features to create smart graph applications. We have thus developed more than 20 plugins and improved the core of Sigma with enhanced interaction features.\r\n\r\nWe define our mission as follows:\r\n\r\n1. To work on **core fixes** and core improvements in collaboration with the Sigma.js team.\r\n2. To develop **integration-ready features** such as filters, tooltips, or Excel exporter.\r\n3. To provide **professional support** for developers to succeed in their projects.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nYou should consider linkurious.js as your primary toolkit for building graph-based applications on the Web if you need:\r\n* to ship your solution quickly;\r\n* to focus on the core value of your application;\r\n* to display large graphs (i.e. larger than 2000 nodes and 5000 edges);\r\n* to interact with the graph visualization;\r\n* development support.\r\n\r\n### Browser Support\r\n\r\nAll modern web browsers are supported, including:\r\n* Internet Explorer 10+\r\n* Chrome 23+ and Chromium\r\n* Firefox 15+\r\n* Safari 6+\r\n\r\nTouch events on tablet and mobile are currently supported as *beta* features.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nPerformance depends on the graph size, the graphic renderers, the computer and browser on which the web application runs.\r\n\r\n* **Canvas** is supported in all modern browsers. It is a great tradeoff between flexibility and performance. Use it to display up to 5 000 nodes and 8 000 edges.\r\n* **WebGL** needs a graph card and is thus not suitable to all clients, but it unlocks the graph size boundaries. It is great to display large graph withs a layout previously computed (e.g. from [Gephi](http://gephi.github.io/)) because the graphic card memory is loaded only once. Use it to display up to 20 000 nodes and 30 000 edges.\r\n* **SVG** is partially supported and is still under active development. It is great for interactivity and animations but performances drop quickly with the number of displayed items. Use it to display up to 500 nodes and 1 000 edges. Notice that an [SVG export plugin](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/tree/linkurious-version/plugins/sigma.exporters.svg) is available to generate files for Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.\r\n\r\nDifferent kinds of renderers can be mixed, and automatic fallback from WebGL to Canvas makes adoption wider and smoother. With linkurious.js your application is not bound to a specific rendering technology anymore!\r\n\r\nSee our [performance guide](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/Performance) to learn more.\r\n\r\n### External Dependencies\r\n\r\nLinkurious.js comes with no external dependency, making it compatible with any Javascript framework and library. We integrate it with [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) in a Linkurious product.\r\n\r\nA few plugins may require external dependencies. Please check their README files.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nYou can contribute by submitting [issues tickets](http://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/issues) and proposing [pull requests](http://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/pulls). Make sure that tests and linting pass before submitting any pull request by running the command `grunt`.\r\n\r\nSee [How to fix bugs](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/How-to-fix-bugs) and to [How to develop plugins](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/wiki/How-to-develop-plugins).\r\n\r\nThe whole source code is validated by the [Google Closure Linter](https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/) and [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/), and the comments are written in [JSDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc) (tags description is available [here](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler)).\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe linkurious.js toolkit is dual-licensed, **available under both commercial and open-source licenses**. The open-source license is the GNU General Public License v.3 (\"GPL\"). In addition to GPL, the Linkurious.js toolkit is available under commercial license terms from [Linkurious SAS](http://linkurio.us).\r\n\r\nGPL has been chosen as the open-source license for linkurious.js, because it provides the following four degrees of freedom:\r\n\r\n1.
